# Roadmap

This roadmap turns the design in `docs/todo.md` into a fully phased build plan.

The core principles follow this:

1. Build the data model first
2. Separate spell meaning from combat-log behavior
3. Add message rules per category, not per spell
4. Keep trinkets lightweight and special-cased
5. Prefer curating abilities over tracking everything
6. Finish one vertical slice cleanly before broad expansion
