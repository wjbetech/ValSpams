# Changelog

## Beta Release 1.0.2-beta.4 (2026.04.26)

- Beta release
  - Use combat-log affiliation flags as an additional ownership check so player-cast Hammer of Justice, taunts, tank warnings, and trinkets are not dropped when GUID or name data is incomplete.
  - Clean up the Korean channel-mode description for the new `Say only` option.

## Beta Release 1.0.2-beta.3 (2026.04.26)

- Beta release
  - Harden player-owned spell detection for Hammer of Justice, taunts, tank warnings, and trinkets when combat-log source data is inconsistent.

- Beta release
  - Fix Hammer of Justice and taunt announcements for tracked target-aura spells.
